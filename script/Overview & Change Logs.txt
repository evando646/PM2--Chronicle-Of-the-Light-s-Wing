  TSBS - Overview
  These informations are aimed for scripter to ensure compatibility without
  reading too many lines.
  
  Compatibility notes :
  > I greatly changed the damage flow from scene battle by overwriting def
    use_item in Scene_Battle. So, if there is any script that also using that 
    method, it's highly will NOT compatible with this script. Also, I don't
    use invoke_item, instead I make my own invoke item method by adding
    tsbs_invoke_item. So, nobody will mess with it
    
  > I haven't touch menu or battle HUD. So, if you planned to make your own
    battle HUD, I'm sure it will be compatible. As long as it doesn't mess
    around wih Game_Actor screen position (screen_x, screen_y)
  
  > For HUD scripters out there, put your HUD refresh on "def refresh_status" 
    or "def status_redraw_target" if using YEA Battle Engine
    
  > Ocedic Battle Camera motion will mess with the battler sprite placement
    and it won't work together with my additional sprites like battler shadow.
    I already made my own battle camera. So, you will need to use mine
  
  > I also haven't touch turn order yet. So far, it's compatible with Yanfly 
    Free turn, Sabakan - Ao no Kiseki battle system, and Fomar ATB, AEA
    Charge Turn Battle
    
  > If you plan to add galv's timed button attack, I'm afraid it will not
    compatible. Since I greatly changed the damage flow. Instead, I have my
    own timed hit. 
    
  > I recommend you to use YEA - Battle Engine. If you refuse it, then if you 
    want to make your own damage popup, just make it yourself. I don't want to 
    make one. Instead, I provided built-in damage counter.
    
  > Since this script is getting bigger, I may work for compatibility. But with
    some notes, only Yanfly scripts and the scripts I like
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Current TSBS Weakness :
  -> You're not allowed to keep the enemy dead sprite in field. It may have 
     graphical glitches. Enemy should perform collapse effect
  -> You can not revive enemy or it may have graphical glitches
  -> Auto reset position. You're not allowed to modify battler position. It
     will automatically reseted back even if you don't do it.
  -> In this current script structure, I'm afraid if I can't do Co-op attack
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Planned added features :
  >> Combo hit?
  >> Grid Battle System?
  >> Custom move sequence for projectile
  >> Add more control on timed hit animation
  >> Focus type fades and blackout
  >> Individual shadow switch
  
  To do list :
  >> Battleback2 need to be fixed (?)
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Added features :
  >> Extended timed-hit features (dodge hit, or whatnot)
  >> Shot projectile from specific coordinate
  >> Shot projectile to specific coordinate
  >> Projectile coordinate adjustment
  >> Change battleback
  >> Balloon optimization
  >> Custom target focus
  >> Folder for battler for easier organize
  >> Subtitue / Cover support
  >> Add shadow y adjustment
  >> Clone battler
  >> Battler rotate
  >> Allow [:while] command parameter input as nested array
  >> Break action
  >> Add auto immortal config
  >> Camera effect
  >> Add battle program like Tankentai VXA did = Battle Decor
  >> Class change battler graphics
  
  Done to do list :
  >> Change how anim_top is handled
  >> Change battleback to plane
  >> Integrate default battle log with multiple hits
  >> Update Z position in animation every frame
  >> Fix the anim state position
  >> Update HUD when add / remove state using sequence
  >> Bugreport : Revival item doesn't do its job
  >> handler for item_in_use if nil
  >> handler for status_window in Game_BattleEvent.
